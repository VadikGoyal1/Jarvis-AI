# üåü Jarvis AI - Your Advanced AI System  

Welcome to **Jarvis AI**, an advanced multi-core AI designed to provide intelligent task execution, real-time system monitoring, and superintelligent capabilities. Inspired by futuristic AI systems, Jarvis combines neural processing, emotional intelligence, and system-level control for personal or professional applications.

## üöÄ Key Features  

### üß† **Core Intelligence**  
- **Neural Core**: A multi-layered neural network for decision-making and processing tasks.  
- **Emotional Core**: Models emotional states like curiosity, surprise, and happiness for adaptive interactions.  
- **Cognitive Core**: Implements short-term, long-term, and working memory for task management.  

### ‚ö° **System Monitoring**  
- Tracks CPU, memory, disk, and network usage in real-time.  
- Logs critical resource usage and system health.  

### üîß **Task Management**  
- Execute and monitor external system commands.  
- Real-time process tracking with start, stop, and status management.

## üéØ Getting Started  

### üìã Prerequisites  

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:  
- Python 3.8 or higher.  
- A GPU with CUDA support for faster neural network computations (optional).  
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install torch psutil pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition numpy
```
  # For GPU support
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu111/torch_stable.html
  ```

### üîß Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jarvis-ai.git
cd jarvis-ai
```

2. Run the main script::  
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```

### üéÆ How to Use

1. Start Jarvis:
Running ``jarvis.py`` initializes all cores and system monitoring.

2. Execute Processes:
Use the ``run_process`` method to execute external system commands.
```bash
    process_id = jarvis.run_process(["ls", "-la"])
print(jarvis.get_process_status(process_id))
```

3. Monitor System Health:
Jarvis logs system resource usage automatically. Retrieve the latest status:
```bash
    print(jarvis.get_system_health())
```

4. Custom Tasks:
Extend Jarvis by adding your modules to the ``AdvancedJarvis`` or ``HyperAdvancedJarvis`` classes.

## üîç Architecture Overview

**Core Levels**
1. Base Jarvis
    - System initialization, voice interaction, and system monitoring.

2. Advanced Jarvis
    -Adds neural networks, emotional cores, and cognitive systems.

3. HyperAdvanced Jarvis
    - Integrates quantum processing, consciousness layers, and advanced neural simulations.

**Modular Components**

- Neural Core: Processes data through a multi-layer perceptron.
- System Monitor: Continuously checks CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
- Process Manager: Tracks and controls running external processes.
